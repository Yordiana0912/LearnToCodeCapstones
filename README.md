Financial App
This application  will allow the user to be able to review deposit , make payment , view ledger and be able to exit once completed 
This application will also provide a report that will track the user interaction 
Transcation screen , it allow us to introduce to the application what we are going to be talking about or working with 
It allow us to set and also get thing from the user & set
On my main screen "AccountingLedgerApplication" will run the application , but starting with the introduction 
This will introduce the client to the application but also ask the user what would they like to do.
After the user enter what they would like to do , the application will then take them to the correct department (deposit
, make a payment, debit informaiton)
I also added buffwriter , which allow the application to write to a file 
i also added a buffreader which allow you to read the file 
The a view Ledger wad add to list all the transaction 
then i created a report option as well
